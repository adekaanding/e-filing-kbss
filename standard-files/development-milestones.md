  * Feature branches will be created for subsequent subphases
  * The application is now running properly with `php artisan serve`
  * This initialization follows the specifications in the project architecture document

## **[Milestone: Subphase 1.2 Database Configuration]**

* **Date Completed:** April 21, 2025

  * Set up Git feature branch for database configuration changes

* **Notes & Observations:**
  * The database structure now follows the ERD specified in the project architecture document
  * Models implement query scopes (available, borrowed, overdue) to facilitate common data access patterns
  * Status fields use enum types in migrations to enforce data integrity
  * User model includes helper methods (isAdmin, isOfficer) to simplify role checking
  * Modified FileSeeder to ensure unique reference numbers across departments
  * All code follows Laravel conventions and SOLID principles as specified in the architecture document
